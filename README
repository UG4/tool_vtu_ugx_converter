---PREREQUIREMENTS---

Needs automake and related build tools.

---INSTALL---

./bootstrap
./configure
make

---USAGE---
<prgm> [-c] [<input>.vtu]+

---MISC---

Assumes vtu files to be in XML-ascii mode - use, e.g., paraview to convert
from binary to ascii format.

The functionality of the converter is intended to increase with needs. 
If your vtu file is not supported, email it to lukas.larisch@kaust.edu.sa

---FUNCTIONALITY---

Points, Edges, Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Tets, Prisms, Pyramids, Quadratic
Tets, Hexahedrons.

-c flag (currently arg 4) combines adds point data to position data and writes
an additional grid. Makes sense for, e.g., displacement. 

Bridge to ug in ug_bridge_vtu.cpp. Tested with ProMesh. Now direct reading of
vtus is possible.
